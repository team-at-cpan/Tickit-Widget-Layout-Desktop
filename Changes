0.011     2017-06-25 03:05:32+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur

0.010     2016-12-31 19:39:00+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    No new features.

    Deprecation fixes:
    * Use ->bind_event instead of ->on_geom_changed, for newer Tickit versions
    * Set cursor position explicitly in new panes, since without this we tend
    to trigger warnings on focus change

0.009     2015-02-06 20:09:42+00:00 Europe/London
    New features:
    * ->weld on the desktop instance for attaching panel edges. Previously
    available in 0.003 but was not exposed via public methods.

0.006     2015-01-24 14:00:26+00:00 Europe/London
    New features:
    * New panels can be given position in %, and there is now suppport for
    'right' and 'bottom' attributes (distance from bottom and right of the
    desktop, respectively)
    * Disabled rounded corners, since ->get_cell has changed in newer Tickit
    versions

0.005     2014-08-31 15:00:19+01:00 Europe/London
    No new features.

    Bugs fixed:
    * Stick-to-bottom-right behaviour - was using the wrong value for lines,
    causing windows to leap to full height occasionally for no good reason
    * Panels now get a default position if none provide in ->create_panel

    New features:
    * Ability to join edges on windows for moving things in parallel
    * Clamp-to-edge
    * Rounded corners are back

    Bugs fixed:
    * Expose handling improved, slightly faster but still plenty of room
    for optimisation.
    * When moving windows, limit them to the available space
